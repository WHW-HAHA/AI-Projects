# A series of completed deep learning projects in Udacity deep learning 

This repository showcases a few completed Deep Learning projects in Udacity Deep Learning program. 
Each project focuses on a specific neural network. 
* Project 1: A typical Neural Network to predict the bike rental ridership
* Project 2: A Convolutional Neural Network to classify the dog breeds
* Project 3: A Recurrent Neural Network to create a fake TV scripts
* Project 4: A Generative Adversarial Network to create the fake hand writing numbers and fake faces
* Project 5: A typical Neural Network to classify the film reviews by their sentiments

All the Neural Networks were trained and verified with the data provided by Udacity.

### Project 1: Predicting bike-sharing patterns
In this project, I built my first neural network and used it to predict the daily bike rental ridership for a specific month.
Below gives the prediction against measurement.

### Project 2: Dog breed classifier
In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural NetWork to read the user-supplied images as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

### Project 3: TV Scripts generation 
In this project, I generated my own Simpson TV scripts by using Recurrent Neural Network. 
The training data set was from the scripts of Simpson season 27. 
The RNNs eventually generated a new "fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

### Project 4: Generate fake hand writing numbers and fake faces 
In this project, I created fake hand writing numbers and fake faces by using Generative Adversarial Network

The fake hand writing numbers of thd first epoch and the eighth epoch

### Project 5: Sentimental classification of film reviews
In this project, I built a Neural Network to classify the film reviews to positive and negative according to the sentiment in the reviews.
